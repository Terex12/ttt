# Call for workshops

Workshop Proposals are solicited for workshops to be held in conjunction with ACM CCS 2024. Each workshop provides a forum to address a specific topic at the forefront of security research.

A workshop associated with CCS must be one full day in length. Proceedings of all such workshops will be available to the workshop attendees. Each workshop will also have online proceedings through the ACM Digital Library, with a separate ISBN. Submissions of workshop proposals must be emailed to the workshop chair AAA (mail@example.com) by **March 18, 2024**. CCS 2024 was approved for a face-to-face conference. However, depending on the Covid-19 situation development, the main conference and workshops could be held on-line or in a mixed format. By submitting a proposal, the proposer agrees to hold the workshop following the main conference format.
