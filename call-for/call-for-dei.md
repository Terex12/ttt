# ACM CCS 2024 DEI Call for Participation

ACM CCS 2024 has assigned chairs specifically dedicated to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) for the first time. This significant step is aimed at bringing specific attention to DEI practices within our community, but our commitment extends beyond that. We strive to create an environment where everyone feels valued and heard, and where DEI principles are not just an add-on, but a fundamental part of our ethos.

## Mission

A crucial part of our mission is to raise and amplify the voices of marginalized individuals, ensuring that everyone, regardless of their background, has an equal opportunity to contribute, learn, grow and benefit. 

#### Why Attend?

* **Challenge Assumptions:** Understand the importance of not making judgments based on assumptions or prejudice. Read more about confirmation bias. 
* **Prevent Misunderstandings:** We all come from different backgrounds, cultures, values, and ways to express ourselves. Misunderstandings and misjudgements are common but can be prevented. Practice how to ask for clarifications and explanations before judging or concluding. 
* **Encourage Open Dialogue:** Engage in meaningful conversations that help break down barriers and build bridges. It is easy to stay in our circles with like-minded people. Challenge ourselves and others to consider different points of views even though it does not serve us directly. 
* **Engage in Keynote Talks and Panel Discussions:** We bring some experts from the security, privacy, and cryptography domain to share their learnings and  efforts they lead.

#### Who Should Attend?

Anyone who is passionate about creating a more inclusive and equitable world. Whether you’re a student, professional, or community member, your voice and perspective are valuable to us.
