# Call for posters & demos

CCS will include poster/demonstration sessions in order to provide a forum to present and discuss works in progress, industry demonstrations of new applications or techniques, research demonstrations and test beds, upcoming research challenges, future directions, and novel approaches in the field of computer and communications security. One of the key goals of this conference is to foster collaboration between industry and academia. Participation of researchers and developers from industry and posters/demonstrations reporting on joint work between industry and academia are therefore especially encouraged. Poster sessions will be held in presence.

## Submission Guidelines

Posters are solicited that present unpublished in-progress or late-breaking research or extensions of published work on security-and privacy-related topics. Authors are asked to submit a short proposal that describes the main contributions of the poster or demonstration. Proposals should contain a brief abstract, place an emphasis on the motivation for the work, and summarize contributions being presented. Preliminary results may also be included. **Submitted proposals must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or accepted for publication, or that are simultaneously in submission to a journal, conference, or workshop with published proceedings. The list of authors cannot be changed after submission or acceptance.** Presentation proposals will be evaluated primarily on their potential to stimulate interesting discussions, facilitate the exchange of ideas, and promote collaborations.

Authors of accepted poster proposals will be provided instructions for preparing the posters. Poster sessions will be held in presence. At least one author of each accepted poster will be required to attend the conference. Questions shall be directed via email to the Poster/Demo Chair.

Proposals should adhere to the ACM double-column format with 3-page maximum (i.e., including title, abstract, content, and any references). Proposals are not blinded, and must contain the authors’ names, affiliations, and contact information. Submissions that are not formatted as described above are subject to rejection without review. All submissions must designate a single corresponding author. In order to be included in the conference, at least one presenter per accepted poster/demo must register for the conference. The accepted posters/demos will be published in the proceedings.
The poster/demo submission system is available at: **[https://ccs2024posters.hotcrp.com/](https://ccs2024posters.hotcrp.com/)**
