# Call for Tutorials

The ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS) is seeking tutorial proposals. As a part of the CCS'24 program, we cordially invite proposals for tutorials from active researchers and experienced tutors from academia, industry and government agencies. Ideally, the tutorial will cover state-of-the-art research and ideas, innovative developments, and novel applications in a specific aspect of security, but proposals are especially encouraged on emerging ideas related to main conference topics.
