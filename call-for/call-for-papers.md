# Call for papers
The ACM International Conference on Supercomputing (ICS) is the premier international forum for the presentation of research results in high-performance computing systems. The xxth edition of ICS will be in Salt Lake City MM D1-DD, 2025.

Papers are solicited on all aspects of the architecture, software, and applications of high-performance computing systems of all scales (from chips to supercomputing systems), including but not limited to:

- Processor, accelerator, memory, storage, interconnect and system architectures, including architectures based on future and emerging hardware (e.g. quantum, photonic, neuromorphic).
- Programming languages, paradigms and execution models, including domain-specific languages and scientific problem-solving software environments.
- Compilers, runtime systems and system software, including optimization and support for hardware resources and energy management.
- High-performance algorithms and applications including machine learning and large-scale data analytics, as well as the implementation and deployment of algorithms and applications on large-scale systems.
- Tools for measurement, modelling, analysis and visualization of performance, energy, or other quantitative properties of high-performance computing systems.
The review process will include a rebuttal period, and the papers will be evaluated based on novelty, technical soundness, and potential impact on the field.
