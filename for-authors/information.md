# Information for Authors
Papers accepted for this conference will be published in the ACM proceedings. ACM's publication policy is as follows.

- By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.

- Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.


# Submissions
Authors will submit papers via the HotCRP conference review software <a href="https://xxx.hotcrp.com/">here</a>. Submissions must be a PDF file in the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template"> ACM conference proceedings template</a>. Submissions should be a maximum of ten (10) pages of single-spaced two-column text, not including references, with a minimum 10pt font.


# Anonymity
Submissions (both abstract and paper) should be prepared for double-blind review, i.e., without author names or other identifying material. The submission system requests information about the authors. This information will not be given to the reviewers. Authors should refer to themselves in the third person when citing their own work. Authors should under no circumstances reveal their identity or affiliation through any side channels, including but not limited to the metadata of the submitted PDF files, their prior work, or acronyms of systems which have already been released to the public. If authors have any doubts on whether any aspect of their submission violates anonymity they should contact the Program Chairs. Authors may contact only the Program Chairs for any matters regarding submitted papers during and after the review process. Contacting PC or ERC members about submitted paper(s) is an ethical violation and grounds for immediate rejection of the paper.


# Concurrent Submissions
The authors guarantee that by submitting a paper to ICS the paper has not been previously published or accepted for publication in the same or substantially similar form in any conference, workshop or journal. Exceptions are only venues without archival proceedings or venues that explicitly state that they don’t preclude conference submissions of the same material. Technical reports and papers posted on public web sites, social media, or online repositories such as Arxiv.org are not considered prior publications. However, authors must refrain from citing or referring to such posted work in any way during the ICS’25 review period to preserve anonymity. The authors should also ensure that the paper does not have substantial overlap with paper(s) submitted concurrently to other venues during the ICS’25 review period. Violation of any of these conditions will lead to immediate rejection. As always, if you are in doubt, it is best to contact the program chairs. Finally, we also note that the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism-overview"> ACM Plagiarism Policy</a> covers a range of ethical issues concerning the misrepresentation of other works or one’s own work.


# Ethical Obligations
- Authors are not allowed to contact reviewers or PC members to encourage or solicit them to bid on any paper.
- Authors are not allowed to attempt to sway a reviewer to review any paper positively or negatively.
- Authors are not allowed to contact reviewers or PC members requesting any type of information about the reviewing process, either in general or specifically about submitted papers.
- Authors are not allowed to contact reviewers or PC members to ask about the outcomes of any papers.
- Authors must also abide by the ACM ethics policy. Violation of the ACM ethics policy may result in rejection of the submission and possible action by the ACM.
- Authors are not allowed to advertise their submissions or related technical reports and postings (e.g., to arxiv.org or online repositories) on social media or community blogs and webpages during the period starting two weeks before the submission deadline and ending when the ICS’25 acceptance results are public.
- ICS’25 follows the ACM Author Representations Policy.

# Upon Acceptance of Your Paper
Authors will be notified of acceptance or rejection on the Decision Notification Date. At this point, contact authors of accepted papers will receive instructions on how to prepare and submit a final version by the Camera-Ready Deadline.

AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date may affect the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. (For those rare conferences whose proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library after the conference is over, the official publication date remains the first day of the conference.)


# Your Paper at the Conference
Authors are required to present their work in a scheduled session with other ICS’25 Papers. Papers whose authors are not at the conference to present their paper may be removed from the ACM Digital Library.

# Acknowledgements
Elements in this document regarding concurrent submissions, anonymity, and ethical obligations are taken from previous SIGARCH conferences, particularly the last two instances of the ASPLOS conference (ASPLOS’24, ASPLOS’23), the program chairs of which we wish to thank.
