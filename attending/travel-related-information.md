## Conference-rate Hotel Rooms

*Update: our blocked rooms are sold out on almost all the dates*

Rooms at the Salt Lake Marriott Downtown at City Creek at the special conference rate ($219/night) are available at this [link](https://book.passkey.com/event/50732318/owner/1441/home). To get this rate, you must book no later than September 15. If rooms are sold out, please contact the registration chairs at Xueqiang Wang (<a href="mailto:xueqiang.wang@ucf.edu">xueqiang.wang@ucf.edu</a>) or Luis A. Garcia (<a href="mailto:la.garcia@utah.edu">la.garcia@utah.edu</a>).

Staying in rooms at the conference hotels helps ACM and the SIG offset the costs of meeting space. We hope that the low, negotiated room rate is an added incentive to stay at the conference hotel. More importantly, the hotel is the center of conference activity, allowing quick access to the programs and functions, as well as the ability to network easily with other attendees

## Nearby Hotels

We also provide a list of hotels that are within walking distance to the conference venue. Please note that: 

1. This list is collected by CCS'24 staff considering the following factors: distance to the conference venue, the ratings on various review websites, and the average daily rate. We do NOT have a contract with any hotel on this list, nor do we endorse any of them. 
2. Hotel rates appear to be highly dynamic, especially when we get close to the check-in date. The approximate rate below may be different from the actual rate you see on the hotel website. 
3. Note that the lowest published rates are almost always very restricted, e.g., they may be nonrefundable and unchangeable. Please consider this factor when you make reservations.
