# ACM CCS 2024 DEI Initiative

**Short bio:**

Jennifer Cheung is a mathematician who became a Cybersecurity Engineer and has been working in the field since August 2014. She has a masters degree in Applied Mathematics and  was awarded a Fulbright grant to study Quantum Cryptography in Denmark during the academic year of 2011-2012. She currently works as a research scientist at a government Research Lab on emerging technologies in cybersecurity. She founded the WiCyS (Women In Cybersecurity) San Diego Affiliate  in August 2020 and was the Affiliate President for three years. She has been outspoken on building a more diverse and inclusive cybersecurity workforce of the future, encouraging and helping women to break into the field.

**Title**: 3 Steps to Fight Bias: Awareness, Facts, and Actions 

**Abstract**: Despite the Equal Pay Act was passed in 1963 by the U.S. Congress, gender pay gap still persists today. According to the Department of Labor statistics, women earned, on average, only 83.6% of men’s in 2023. This gap remains for the past two decades with little progress to narrow it. Years after years, the Women In Workplace study, which is the largest comprehensive study of the state of women in corporate America, has shown that women are still underrepresented at the management and senior leadership roles. The study has suggested that bias is what holds women at the very first step on the corporate ladder, often being overlooked for promotions.
 
Attendees of this workshop will learn about their own unconscious bias, the facts on gender inequality and empowerment, and actions they can take to create a diverse, equal and inclusive environment for all. We, both men and women, must work together to achieve this goal because gender equality is not a women’s issue and it is good for everyone. The workshop will conclude with what benefits it will bring when we have a gender equal world, such as closing the gender pay gap.

**Title**: Research, Internships, and Career Paths in Industry Labs

**Abstract**: In the competitive landscape of research and development, research roles in industry offer unique opportunities for PhD students and junior researchers to advance their careers. However, research in industry also comes with challenges, some of which may be more acute for women and under-represented groups. This talk will delve into the difficulties and specific pathways available within industry, from engaging in important research projects to successful internships that pave the way for full-time positions to the variety of industry research work products and how to support future mobility. The speaker will share insights from personal experience and the aggregate experience of colleagues; attendees will gain an understanding of how to navigate and thrive in industry labs. This talk will help attendees grow a comprehensive toolkit for successfully landing positions in industry labs and advancing their careers and career mobility.

## Short-term DEI Goals

In our pursuit of long-term DEI goals, we plan to organize panels featuring individuals who are actively implementing DEI initiatives in their organizations. These panels will provide practical takeaways for our community, helping us all to learn and grow together. We also foster community and culture of DEI within the Security and Privacy (S&P) field through networking events and inclusive conversation practices.

## Mission

A crucial part of our mission is to raise and amplify the voices of marginalized individuals, ensuring that everyone, regardless of their background, has an equal opportunity to contribute, learn, grow and benefit.

## Call to Action

We believe that each one of us has something unique to contribute to the cause regardless of our differences. We encourage everyone to actively participate and serve the community. Your experiences, insights, and perspectives can help us create a more inclusive and diverse environment.
