# In-Person Posters for papers from ACM CCS 2020 and 2021

ACM CCS 2022 is thrilled to have an in-person conference after two years of virtual conferences. The poster session this year will be held in a combined format to accept new posters and to offer an opportunity to authors of accepted papers from the 2020 and 2021 ACM CCS Conference that were virtual to present their papers as posters in-person.

## Submission Guidelines

There is no review process for posters of accepted papers from the 2020 and 2021 ACM CCS Conference. Authors registered before the submission deadline will be provided instructions for preparing the posters. 

At least one author of each accepted poster will be required to attend the conference in person.

Due to limited space, the submissions will be accepted on a "first come first served" basis. Authors registered before the submission deadline will be notified and posters submitted after the deadline might be accepted if there is room for additional posters. All authors will be notified by September 6, 2022.
